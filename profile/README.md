## About Artmyn
Artmyn is the leader in digital authentication and unique, immersive digital experiences for collectors of fine art.

Artmyn revolutionized the online art viewing experience with its cutting-edge scanner technology, allowing art to be viewed at 
nanometer resolution across a range of light frequencies —including visible, ultraviolet, and infrared— on any device. 
This solution has dramatically changed how art is experienced, bought, and sold at auction, increasing transparency and buyer 
confidence as well as providing a new level of experiencing and sharing art.
